# spotify_skip_prediction_technocolabs_internship
The task is to predict whether individual tracks encountered in a listening session will be skipped by a particular user. In order to do this, complete information about the first half of a userâ€™s listening session is provided, while the prediction is to be carried out on the second half. Participants have access to metadata, as well as acoustic descriptors, for all the tracks encountered in listening sessions.  The output of a prediction is a binary variable for each track in the second half of the session indicating if it was skipped or not, with a 1 indicating that the track skipped, and a 0 indicating that the track was not skipped.
